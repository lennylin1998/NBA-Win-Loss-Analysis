## NBA Analysis Season 2020-21
Tableau Public Link ðŸ‘‰ https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lenny.lin/viz/NBAAnalysisSeason2020-21/NBAAnalysis
### Objective
I create a dashboard where you can find out **how one team performs against the other one specific team** compare to **how they do during the whole season**. I want to spot the weakness of the championship contender, and the strength of a rebuilding team! The tools will mainly be **Python** and **Tableau Public**.
By creating this dashboard, I discover a few fun facts. For example, Brooklyn Nets have been outscored their average points(average points of all games this season) when facing Cavaliers, but they have done a horrible job secure the boards. That cause them 2 games out of 3 against CLE. With that being said, there are still more to unveil in the dashboard!
